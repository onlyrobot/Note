## What AI can do

* Perception
* Action
* Reasoning
* Problem-solving
* Learing and Adaptation
* Sociality
* Creativity

## Strong/Weak AI

* Behavior/action(weak AI), Turing test
* Thought process/reasoning(strong AI), Chinese Room

## Approches

* Leaning(child machine)
* Connectionism
* Symbolic AI
* Evolutionary Computation(artificial life)
* Computational Swarm Intelligence
* Nouvelle AI

## Machine Learning

improve behavior/performance on task by learning from experience

* Supervised Learning
* Unsupervised Learning(clustering)
* Semi-supervised Learning
* Reinforcement Learning

### Learning issues

* Overfitting(generalization ability)
* Bias
* Robustness
* Transparency
* Computation Complexity

## Connectionism

### history

M-P neuron -> Perceptron -> Hopfield Model, B-P Learning Method -> Deep Learning

### Core Issues

* Topology
* Learning Method

## Symbolic AI

Problem-solving -> Expert System -> Knowledge Engineering

* Search, Representation, Reasoning
* GPS, Deep Blue, DENDRAL, CYC...

## Evolutionary Computation

Buy modeling the processes of biological evolution on computer, it turns out that we can sometimes get the computers to evolve solutions to problems

* Population
* Selection
* Mutation

## Artificial Life(Alife)

Artificial Life is the study of man-makde systems that exhibit behaviors charactorisitic of natural living systems. It complements the traditional biological sciences concerned with the analysis of living organisms by attempting to synthesize life-like behaviors within computers and other artificial media.

## Computational Swarm Intelligence

Intelligence can emerged from social interaction. Swarm intelligence simulate social interaction, and emergent collective intelligence of groups of simple agents.

* Multi-Agent Systems
* Ant Colony Optimization
* Particle Swarm Optimization

## Nouvelle AI

Intellligence without Representation. The basic building blocks of intelligence are very simple behaviours, More complex behaviours "emerge" from the interaction of these simple behaviours.
